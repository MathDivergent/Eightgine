See last stable engine version 0.3.0 [here](https://github.com/MathDivergent/Eightgine/releases).

Engine folder structure:
- Eightgine - Contains 3 key folders.
	- Windows|Linux|macOS & Frameworks - Contains executables and shared libraries. The executable file generated by the build depending on the EIGHTGINE_WITH_EDITOR option will run an empty project with or without the editor.
	- Development - Contains files needed to develop the project. Contains a template CMakeLists.txt file for building the project.
		- Engine - Contains the source code of the engine and editor.
			- ThirdParty - Contains source files of third-party libraries, frameworks needed for the engine and editor.
		- Game - Contains a source code template for building the executable file of the project.
		- Intermediate - Contains build artifacts and intermediate files. Can be deleted.
		- Resources - Contains serialized data, editor assets.
		- PlugIns - Contains engine plugins.

Project folder structure:
- Project - Contains 3 key folders. Can have any name.
	- Windows|Linux|macOS & Frameworks - Contains executable files and shared libraries. The executable file generated by the build, depending on the EIGHTGINE_WITH_EDITOR option, will run the project with or without the editor.
	- Development - Contains the files needed to develop the project. Contains a copy of the CMakeLists.txt file template for building the project. Can be changed by the developer.
	- Game - Contains the project source code. Contains a copy of the source code template for building the executable file of the project.
		- ThirdParty - Contains source files of third-party libraries, frameworks needed for the project.
	- PlugIns - Contains both engine and game plugins.
	- Resources - Contains serialized data, project assets.

Build folder structure:
- Project - Contains 2 key folders. Can have any name.
	- Windows|Linux|macOS & Frameworks - Contains executables and shared libraries.
	- PlugIns - Contains game plugins.
	- Resources - Contains serialized data, project assets.

Notes:
- Windows|Linux|macOS & Frameworks - Custom libraries added to CMakeLists.txt will be copied automatically.
- Development - Can be removed for building with the EIGHTGINE_WITH_EDITOR option enabled.

For building under Qt Creator (one of the two):
- It is necessary to specify the path for each configuration: "Intermediate/BUILD_TYPE".

- Go to Edit -> Preferences -> Build & Run -> Default Build Properties and set the Default build directorty field to "./Intermediate/%{BuildConfig:Name}".

For building under CLion:
- It is necessary to specify the path for each configuration: "Intermediate/BUILD_TYPE".
